### New Features!
  - [Meteor M2 full decoding!](METEOR.md)
  - Nginx webserver to show images with preview thumbnails
  - Timestamp and satellite name over every image

### Install
There's an [install.sh](install.sh) script that does everything at once. If in doubt, see the [install guide](INSTALL.md)
